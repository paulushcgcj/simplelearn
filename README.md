# The Northwind Corp

This demo project is based on the Northwind demo database, which provides a sample dataset for managing company information. The frontend and backend components work together to perform CRUD operations on the data, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete company entries. By utilizing the Northwind demo database, this project serves as a practical example of how to interact with real-world data in a web application.
